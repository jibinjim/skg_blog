# Unapologetic

Are you free sometime?

None of your concern. Let me know what its about and let me decide whether its worth my time or attention. Most likely I have better things to do with my free time. I also take efforts at doing things efficiently so that I can have the free time thus earned to myself. I loathe to sqaunder that away on unorganised souls or random conversations. 

Can I have your number?

Ideally I prefer that one does not ask me that question. Given the call friendly country that India is, I realised that its easier to just give the number and don't bother about it than attempting to navigate that with a "No, you may not". So yes, you may have my number. But that don't mean you will be able to reach me on my phone. Try me. 

Please share.

I don't care much for such requests. Tell me what its about, and let me decide whether it is worth sharing. An image or video forwarded on WhatsApp with the message "please share" - that just plain irritates me. 

I don't accept mementos

Yes. I have heard the argument several times over - its a gesture and yada yada. Well, for my side of the argument, its an inconvenience to me - just plain carrying it back, keepig it at my place and throwing it away at a later point in time. I neither wish that you inconvenience me by giving a memento nor do I wish that you inconvenience yourself by getting one. Wish to excuse myself from any polite conversations on the matter further at the expense of coming off as rude or insensitive. Different people have different prefernces and ways of viewing things. I'm just respecting mine. 

Do you have a business card?

I don't. I don't intend to have one also anymore. One quick search with my name will get you my email. You don't need a card anymore. 

It's urgent

People operate with different scales and thresholds for urgency. So instead of telling me its urgent 

I don't pick calls from unknown numbers

I just don't. Also, I don't save most numbers also on my phone. So go figure. 

I have emailed and haven't heard from you

I read all emails. I write back to the ones I feel like and when I feel like. Sometime, my processig rule is also that, I don't conisder replying unless the person has followed up once or twice. I am also working on a whitelist for my email. Once that is also in place, most likely your email would come to my attention only few days down the line. 

I don't do connects

You may mail the person you wish to connect to and mark me in cc if need be. That also makes it easier for me to put in a good word if I wish to. 

Will you refer / recommend me

Not if we haven't worked together enough for me to be able to vouch for your work.
