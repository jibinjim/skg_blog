# Nothing before 11am

This will have to be my default response to anyone who asks me for calls or meetings or anything of that sort. My mornings belong to me. I am a morning person and mornings happen to be my most productive time. Mornings are also when I attend to my priorty activities. So yes, nothing before 11am.
