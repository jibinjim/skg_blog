## Now

Primarily, I am engaged fully with building out the non profit, Rethink. Most of my time and mindshare goes into that. 

I offer a course at a nearby business school as guest faculty. Doing it for the fun of it than anything else. 

I undertake independent consulting engagements. Usually have a max of two at a time. 

I also have voluntary advisory or guidance roles with few startups -- in addition to curating a circle of founders & angels from Kerala. 

Aside of all that, I end up spending an inordinate amount of time playing board games and helping others discover the joy of board games.
