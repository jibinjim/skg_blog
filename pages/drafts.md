# All my notes are drafts

All my notes here on this page may be treated as drafts. They are to be reviewed, edited and rewritten. I tend to publish immediately after I have written, without proofreading that too and look to get back at a later point to revise them - lest it be not published at all. Some I make edits quickly, some I get back from time to time, some I get back after a period of time and others I sometimes never manage to get back even. This approach runs the risk of some or most pieces even making it to their final drafts - they will atleast be published though. The alternative is to risk not being published at all. I choose the former.
