# We wish to invite you as a judge for our hackathon / startup / other program in our college

One category of invitations I religiously decline are the ones to be on judging panels. I view my role as that of a facilitator and not soothsayer. I also believe that everyone is capable of navigating to good outcomes given sufficient time & required guidance. This can be viewed as a direct extention of our stated credo since Startup Village days of "We don't judge ideas". Given this context, I patently find it not fitting for me to be on judging panels. The answer hence is no.
